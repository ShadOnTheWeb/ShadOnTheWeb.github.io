                <h2>The Rook:</h2>
                <p>
                    The rook, also known as a tower or castle, is a mighty piece, sometimes thought of as the army's artillery. While not as mobile as the queen or the knight, the rooks are powerful and threatening, especially once they've emerged from their corners. They can move in a straight line in four directions, as many spaces as they want, therefore potentially dominating entire ranks or files on the board. When used together or in cooperation with the queen, they can easily force the king to move in a certain direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rooks can also perform a useful strategic move in combination with the king, called "castling." In a castle, a player moves his king from his original spot, two spaces to the left or right, towards a rook which is also still standing on its original corner space. He then places that rook on the space that the king jumped over. In order to be able to castle, there must be no pieces between the king and the rook in question, and neither the king nor the rook, nor any of the spaces between them, can be within attacking range of an opposing piece. Also, after a piece has been moved at least one time during the game, that piece can no longer be used to castle. I demonstrate castling in the below video.
