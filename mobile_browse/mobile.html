            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>I was asked to do all my non-homework-related browsing on my mobile phone for 24 hours using the mobile browser. I used Safari on my iPhone to do this. Normally I don't use the internet except for school and work, so I had to make up a couple excuses to have something to browse for. I browsed wikipedia to learn about Iceland's history, and I followed a link to icelandreview.com to learn about the Icelandic national anthem. I also listened to music on youtube.com. </p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>On the sites that I visited, I didn't come across any situations where I couldn't see something I wanted to see.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>I found what I was looking for just fine. In fact, it was more convenient to find those things on my phone instead of getting out my computer to look them up. The only thing that was less convenient to find was the name of the track in the youtube playlist I listened to--I had to scroll all the way down the playlist to see which track was highlighted to see what was playing. I wish it would have shown the track name at the top, where the video and playlist name were.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>I'm sure there are things I would be unable to do comfortably on the mobile browser, but as for the things I did during those 24 hours, none of them were inhibited by the mobile browser. One thing I am very pleased with is that the adblocker works just as well on the mobile browser as it does on the pc, so I was able to listen to music on youtube without being interrupted by ads. Gmail's mobile site even allowed me to add my tutoring appointments directly to google calendar from the notification email, which I was surprised at, since the gmail iPhone app doesn't allow that feature.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>The only frustration I noticed was when icelandreview.com had a top nav-bar that toggled large and small as I approached/left the top of the page, causing the text to skip up and down, which made the first paragraph difficult to read.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>I didn't find any such thing.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Overall, my experience with mobile browsing was fairly smooth; my phone accessed internet pages more quickly than my laptop does, but it is more inconvenient to type things on the small touch-screen than on my computer keyboard. I wasn't too surprised by anything, as I'm not a stranger to mobile browsing. I learned that mobile sites are fairly well designed, and they have come a long way in the past decade.</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
